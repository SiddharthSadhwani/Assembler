INPUT FORMAT FOLLOWED IN OUR ASSEMBLER:
->Make sure that the input file is in the same directory as the Assemblr.py file.
->Maximum instruction length (word length) is 19 bits.
->All commands are to be entered in uppercase.
->Memory addresses are to entered as decimals.
->Valid Memory addresses include addresses from 0 to 28671(decimal).
->All constants are to be enclosed within single or double quotes(eg. '7' or "7").
->Label are to be followed by a semi-colon and a single space.(eg. L1: DSP 123).
->Label and Variables declaration is alpha-numeric and cannot start with a number.
->Variables can only be used to declare constants.
->The assembler only processes instructions between keyword "START" and "END".
->Maximum value of a constant that can be initialized is 4095.
->A particular Label or Variable cannot be declared twice.
->Branching statement only branch to a Label or an address.
